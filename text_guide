[Preface]
After Optifine was disallowed for speedrunning on version 1.16, there has been some confusion as to which mods can you use to boost your FPS.
I've created this short text guide you can easily follow to prepare a fresh Fabric 1.16.1 installation, coupled together with MrMangoHands Sodium port to enhance your gameplay and achieve that PB you've always wanted!
Note that this guide is aimed at users on PC using the Minecraft Launcher.

[Conventions]
In this guide, I give links directly to download the necessary files. Being the Internet and all, I don't expect them to last forever; hence, I will put in parenthesis a detailed explanation to what you should do in case the download does not work, and if they did work, you may freely skip them.
Additionally, I put in <angled brackets> any files that I will later reference to.
And finally, "go to PATH" means navigating to the mentioned directory path on your Windows PC, the easiest ways are using explorer address bar or by using Run (pressing WinKey + R) and pasting the path.
The guide assumes that your Minecraft directory resides at its default location: %appdata%/.minecraft. If you moved it, make sure to fix any relevant paths.

# Download required files:
<Fabric Installation> for the Minecraft Launcher: https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.6.1.51/fabric-installer-0.6.1.51.exe
(Look for an installation that can install Minecraft 1.16.1 on your current Launcher version. Right now the installation is generic and appears on https://fabricmc.net/use/)

<MrMangoHands Sodium> port jar file: https://mrmangohands.github.io/sodium-redirect/
<MrMangoHands Lithium> port jar file: https://mrmangohands.github.io/lithium-redirect/
<MrMangoHands Phosphor> port jar file: https://mrmangohands.github.io/phosphor-redirect/
(The above are backports of Sodium, Lithium and Phosphor for Fabric and are currently open-source and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/mrmangohands/sodium-fabric, https://github.com/mrmangohands/lithium-fabric and https://github.com/mrmangohands/phosphor-fabric they are based on Jellysquid's versions which are much more mature and I believe will support 1.16.1 for longer. They are currently hosted at https://github.com/jellysquid3/)

# Install Fabric
- Launch your <Fabric Installation> executable.
- Pick Minecraft Version: 1.16.1, do not change anything else unless you know what you're doing.
- Your installation should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/ePTlhYo.png

# Install mods

- Click play, and accept the warning shown.
- After the game loads, exit it.
- Go to %appdata%\.minecraft\mods
- Copy <MrMangoHands Sodium>, <MrMangoHands Lithium> and <MrMangoHands Phosphor> files to this directory

At this point, you're done! So, from now on, when you feel like speedrunnin':
- Open your Minecraft Launcher
- Pick "fabric-loader-1.16.1" from the version options on the bottom left: https://i.imgur.com/lyha4ST.png
- Click play, enjoy, and good luck on your speedruns!

# Additional helpful tips
- After launching your Fabric-1.16.1, go to Options -> Video Settings -> Unofficial tab and check "Use Planar Fog".
- Open %appdata%\.minecraft\options.txt search for "gamma" and change the line written there to "gamma:5.0".
